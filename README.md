This repository contains HeatGrid simulation models input function.

## HeatGrid

HeatGrid is a node-based quasi-dynamic simulation model. It has been previously developed at DSEE department of IMT ATLANTIQUE.

This repository contains the main.jl to launch heatgrid simulation model. However, it requires the sources codes from scr/ folder which is not present in this repository but it can be made available at request.
